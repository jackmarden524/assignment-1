        <h2>Traits Around the House</h2>
        <p>Katie is a <strong>tortoiseshell</strong> cat, which always comes with <strong>sassy</strong> behavior
while waiting for meals, or early mornings screaming for attention. Despite how awful this sounds, she
still is very loving and charismatic.</p>

        <h2>Fights</h2>
        <p>I have another cat. His name is Ozzy, and Ozzy and Katie fight a lot.
Katie smacks Ozzy every time he walks by. They have never really gotten along, and unfortunetly I dont 
think they ever will</p>
